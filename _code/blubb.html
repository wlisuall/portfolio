                <p>
                    <strong class="intro">It began with a challenge from our professor</strong>: design a new, innovative 
                    application or technology that utilised popular topics in technology to address a social issue. Our team, 
                    a group of four university students, were given the task of using the Internet of Things to help or provide 
                    relief for those in need of mental wellness care. We thus came up with Blubb: a safe space where people can 
                    share their problems, worries, and anxieties and receive written support back.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The first step to creating an application—or in this case, a prototype, an MVP—is to brainstorm. When 
                    thinking of the term <em>mental wellness</em>, the first keywords to mind were <em>comfort</em> and 
                    <em>validation</em>. People feel uplifted and supported when they receive kindness from other people, and 
                    after establishing this, we decided we wanted to make a social app. But how would we make a social 
                    platform that was different from Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, etc.?
                </p>

                <p>
                    The answer was to travel back in time to when social media wasn't a possibility. To before emails existed 
                    and communication was physical. The application we were going to create was going to revitalize that 
                    physicality and awaken the more intimate aspects of communication, partially removing the screen that 
                    stands between people today. Without breaching one's safe space by removing anonimity, Blubb would act 
                    as the middle man—or app—that would give users an opportunity to make deeper connections, one that felt 
                    more personal than a comment beneath a post.
