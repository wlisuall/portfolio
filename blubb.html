                <p>
                    <span class="intro">It began with a challenge from our professor</span>: design a new, innovative 
                    application or technology that utilised popular topics in technology to address a social issue. Our team, 
                    a group of four university students, was assigned the task of using the Internet of Things to help or provide 
                    relief to those in need of mental wellness care. We thus came up with Blubb: a safe space where people can 
                    share their problems, worries, and anxieties and receive written support back.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The first step to creating an application—or in this case, a prototype, an MVP—is to brainstorm. When 
                    thinking of the term <em>mental wellness</em>, the first keywords that came to mind were <em>comfort</em> and 
                    <em>validation</em>. People feel uplifted and supported when they receive kindness from others, and 
                    after establishing this, we decided we wanted to make a social app. But how could we make a social 
                    platform that was different from Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, etc.?
                </p>

                <p>
                    The answer was simple. In order to make the application unique, we decided to combine the past and present 
                    together. Our application was going to reintroduce the more intimate aspect of long-distance communication: 
                    physicality. When a user goes to reply to another person's post, their comment will then be printed out 
                    as a physical post card that will be sent to the original poster. Without breaching either user's privacy, 
                    Blubb was to act as the middle man between users, giving them an opportunity to make deeper and more 
                    personal connections.

                <p>
                    After determining our product, we conducted research on our target users to confirm what the assumptions
                    we made, specifically that a) letters are more personal than online comments, b) it is comforting when 
                    strangers reach out, c) people prefer anonymity when discussing their mental health. 27 participants 
                    took part in the survey<sub>*</sub>, and these we found the following results:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            66.6% agreed that physical letters are more personal than online messages. Furthermore, no one 
                            expressed strong disagreement with the statement.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Survey population had mixed feelings about feeling comfort when strangers reach out; even though 
                            the majority did agree or strongly agreed with the statement, they consisted of only 37% of all survey 
                            participants. 29.6% felt netural while 33.3% disagreed or strongly disagreed.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The large majority (44.4%) felt netural about preferring to discuss mental health with strangers vs 
                            people they know. 29.6% disagreed or strongly disagreed, while 25.9% agreed or strongly agreed.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although there is a lot of varying opinions on the three statements we posed, we decided that, when 
                    combined, the minority felt negatively about handwritten letters and anonymous discussions on their mental 
                    health. Thus, we found that we justified the value of our MVP and proceeded with sketching, wireframing, 
                    and creating high-fidelity mockups.

                        *The survey does contain some flaws, particularly its failure to measure participants' frequency of 
                        social media usage and how they use social media. Also, our survey failed to take into account what 
                        types of social media platforms they frequent, as these also affect their following responses.
