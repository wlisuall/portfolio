                <p>
                    <span class="intro">It began with a challenge from our professor</span>: design a new, innovative 
                    application or technology that utilised popular topics in technology to address a social issue. Our team, 
                    a group of four university students, was assigned the task of using the Internet of Things to help or provide 
                    relief to those in need of mental wellness care. We thus came up with Blubb: a safe space where people can 
                    share their problems, worries, and anxieties and receive written support back.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The first step to creating an application—or in this case, a prototype, an MVP—is to brainstorm. When 
                    thinking of the term <em>mental wellness</em>, the first keywords that came to mind were <em>comfort</em> and 
                    <em>validation</em>. People feel uplifted and supported when they receive kindness from others, and 
                    after establishing this, we decided we wanted to make a social app. But how could we make a social 
                    platform that was different from Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, etc.?
                </p>

                <p>
                    The answer was simple. In order to make the application unique, we decided to combine the past and present 
                    together. Our application was going to reintroduce the more intimate aspect of long-distance communication: 
                    physicality. When a user goes to reply to another person's post, their comment will then be printed out 
                    as a physical post card that will be sent to the original poster. Without breaching either user's privacy, 
                    Blubb was to act as the middle man between users, giving them an opportunity to make deeper and more 
                    personal connections.
